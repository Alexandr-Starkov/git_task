Once upon a time there was a little girl. Her mother loved her dearly, and her grandmother even more.
For her granddaughter's birthday, her grandmother gave her a black leather jacket.
Since then the girl wore it everywhere. That's what the neighbors used to say about her:
- "Here comes the Black Jacket!
One day her mother baked a cake and said to her daughter:
- "Go to your grandmother's house, Black Jacket, bring her a pie and a pot of butter.
and see if she's well.
So Black Jacket got ready and went to her grandmother.
